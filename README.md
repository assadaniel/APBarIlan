# KNN algorithm to determine the type of an iris.

This project was made by Daniel Assa and Daniel Lifshitz.
## Type finding
It's currently meant to implement the KNN algorithm with iris types, for a given unclassified iris, we find its *K CLOSEST NEIGHBOURS* and from them determine its type,
using the following three different types of irises: *setosa*, *virgincia*, *versicolor*. 
## Classes
 The ```Iris``` class, so we would be able to handle each iris alone.
The ```IrisComp``` class so we would be able to compare objects where each one holds an iris and a number, and be able to work with it and use it seemlessly as a number.
The ```IrisReader``` class so we would be able to read a file filled with information about irises and convert it to an iris object.
The ``` KSmallestElements```, so we would be able to implement the KNN algorithm.
and so we would be able to to determine the type of the iris given to us using the algorithm.
